## Start

Begin the class by logging into Google Classroom for today's lesson and setting up your name tent.

## Do Now 

We'll be exploring your opinions on technology. For each statement in our Padlet, let us know if you **Strongly Agree**, **Agree**, **Disagree**, or **Strongly Disagree**. Feel free to explain your answer!

1. Technology can improve people's lives.
2. Websites and apps can be used to solve important problems.
3. I can use coding to explore things I'm interested in or am passionate about.

## Learning Goals

- Learn about the Unit 2 project.
- Start planning for your project.

## Project Introduction 

We will watch a video about 15-year-old George Hofstetter, who used his coding skills to make a difference. Consider the following after watching the video:

1. How did George use his coding skills to address an issue he cared about?
2. What impact did his work have?
3. Can you think of other examples of apps, websites, or technology addressing important issues?

## Inspiration & Ideas

Check out the Project Planning Document in Google Classroom and go to "Inspiration and Ideas". Take the next few minutes to explore at least two of the example websites listed. Keep these questions in mind:

1. What common features did you notice in the websites?
2. How did these websites inform visitors about the issue they were addressing?
3. What stylistic features made the websites stand out?

## Project Planning

It's time to plan your project! Our project goal is to create an informational website that:

1. Clearly communicates its purpose.
2. Uses different types of information (text, images, videos).
3. Is stylish and easy to read and navigate.

Let's brainstorm for your project. Today's goals are:

1. Fill out the "Let's Brainstorm" section in your Project Planning Document.
2. If you finish early, move on to the "Let's Research" section.

## Project Building

We'll use HTML and CSS to build the homepage of a website about an issue or topic you're passionate about. The website should inform people about your chosen topic in an engaging and easy-to-use way.

The website could be about any topic you care about, like climate change, gender equality, racial justice, LGBT rights, gun control, etc.

## Exit Ticket & Closing

Reflect on today's class by answering the following questions:

1. Whatâ€™s one thing you completed today?
2. Did you meet your goal?
3. Whatâ€™s one thing that challenged you?
4. What will you work on next time we return to the project?

Lastly, don't forget to give some shout outs and submit your Project Plan as your Exit Ticket today! We're excited to see what you'll create. Happy coding! ðŸš€
